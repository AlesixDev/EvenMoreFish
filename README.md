# üê† EvenMoreFish Spigot Plugin üêü

Improve your server's fishing experience with a jaw-dropping, awe-inspiring, mesmerising **fishing plugin** based on elsiff's MoreFish plugin

With over 70 custom fish straight out the box, and the ability to add your own, why go anywhere else?

## ‚≠ê Features ‚≠ê

* ### Custom item support
Use any in-game item, or even a base-64 head in place of a fish and with the option to give the player effects, it makes this plugin highly customizable for use in your own server. 

* ### Rarities
There's 4 rarities in the default config, but it's possible to add your own in the `rarities.yml` file, with its own colour, drop frequency, standard fish length (though you can set a length for individual fish too)

* ### Competitions
Competitions are  W.I.P feature, but for now the plans are to have multiple contest types that can be activated/deactivated in config. **Largest fish**, **First to fish a specific fish** and **first to catch every fish in a given rarity**. For the last one, it's possible to set which rarities are picked from, to prevent the competition being too hard

* ### Configuration
This plugin is *highly* customisable, pretty much everything can be modified to your liking, even the messages (`messages.yml`). There is a detailed explanation for each line in the config to guide you through, a discord support server (coming soon) and wiki (coming soon)

## ‚öô Contributing ‚öô

If you're seeing this here, it's most likely you're looking at an early commit, or that I forgot about the README, but I am yet to decide how to figure out working with people who want to contribute. I look forward to having a plugin that is worth contributing to.

Cheers, Oheers
